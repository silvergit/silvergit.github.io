[{"content":"Comparing Major Linux Distributions: Based on Available Packages in Repositories A key question to ask yourself when choosing a Linux distribution is: Which one has the most packages available in its repositories for installation? In other words, in which distribution do you have the most freedom to install various programs?\nGiving a definitive answer to this question is very difficult. There are many reasons why a clear-cut answer isn\u0026rsquo;t possible, but I\u0026rsquo;ll list a few:\nIn the AUR, we don\u0026rsquo;t download ready-to-install packages; we only receive the installation instructions for them. A high package count isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a good thing; the stability of the distribution is more important. Third-party repositories are not considered in this comparison because they are not easily quantifiable. Ranking Based on Package Count in Repositories 1. Archlinux + AUR - The Unrivaled King Main Arch Linux repository: Approximately 15,000 high-quality and up-to-date packages. AUR repository: A true giant with over 90,000 packages! Here, users upload build scripts (PKGBUILD) for almost any software you can imagine. Thanks to the AUR, almost any program is available for installation in the repositories, and you always get the latest version. This method keeps you constantly updated and gives you access to a world of packages, but the flip side is that your system may become unstable due to using these packages. 2. Fedora + RPM Fusion - The Balanced Choice Main repository: About 60,000 tested and secure packages. By enabling the RPM Fusion repository, you enter a world of installable packages. Unlike the AUR, RPM Fusion provides pre-compiled binaries instead of source-based packages, meaning faster and easier package installation. 3. openSUSE + OBS - The Most Management Tools The main openSUSE repository has about 20,000 stable packages. By enabling OBS (Open Build Service), you gain access to over 125,000 packages. OBS doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in a centralized manner like the AUR. You need to manually add repositories to your system by searching on its website or using tools. 4. Ubuntu + PPA - Convenience at the Cost of Fragmentation Main repository: Between 60,000 to 70,000 packages. Personal Package Archives (PPA) are created and maintained by users. You have to search for them. The trustworthiness, currency, and security of PPAs are not uniform and can vary greatly. 5. Debian - Complete Stability Main repository: 64,000 secure and thoroughly tested packages. Packages are rigorously tested for compatibility and security. Other software must be compiled manually. Summary Based on Package Count in Repositories Distribution Main Repo Supplementary Repo Total Accessible Packages Strength Weakness Arch Medium (~15k) AUR (Largest ~90k+) 100,000+ Latest versions, comprehensiveness Requires more technical knowledge Fedora Large (~60k) RPM Fusion (Very Large) ~80,000+ Excellent balance between new and stable Requires enabling an additional repo openSUSE Medium (~20k) OBS (Very Large ~125k) ~140,000+ Excellent tools, stable Lower popularity, fewer Persian resources Ubuntu Very Large (from Debian) PPAs (Fragmented) Unspecified (Very High) Large community, abundant guides Inconsistent PPA quality Debian Very Large (~64k) Very Limited ~64,000 (Stable) Unparalleled stability \u0026amp; security Older software versions Which Distribution is Right for You? Distribution Key to Accessing the Software World Best For Arch Linux AUR (Over 90k packages) Technology seekers, customization enthusiasts, those who want the latest versions. Fedora Main repo + RPM Fusion Those seeking balance between up-to-date software and system stability. openSUSE Main repo + OBS Professional users who need power, excellent management tools, and extensive, high-quality repositories. Ubuntu Main repo + PPAs Beginners and those who prefer convenience, extensive support, and abundant tutorials. Debian Main repo only (Stable) Server administrators and those who prioritize stability and security over everything else—even being up-to-date.

I will update this post with every change I make to my own site and add any new features I use.\nDifference Between Static and Dynamic Sites The first thing we need to discuss is whether you need a static site or a dynamic site. A static site is a collection of html, css, or JavaScript files that are displayed to the user exactly as they were coded. Any changes are only shown to the user by modifying the site\u0026rsquo;s code. In contrast, a dynamic site displays content interactively to the user without needing to edit the code, and its content can be changed dynamically. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s compare these two types of sites.\nStatic sites are very fast and require minimal cost for development and setup. However, their content is fixed, they have very limited features, and managing the site becomes very difficult as it grows.\nDynamic sites have dynamic content. They can interact with users, content management is very easy, and they have advanced features. However, they are slower, more complex to develop, and require significantly higher costs for setup and maintenance.\nWhich One Should I Choose If you are a blogger, need a small personal site, or want to create a small educational site, it is better to use a static site. However, if you are planning a large project, a commercial venture, or something like an online store, you should definitely opt for a dynamic site.\nSetting Up a Static Site with Hugo and GitHub Pages Introduction Hugo is a fast and modern framework for building static sites, written in Go. GitHub Pages is a free hosting service for static sites. Combining these two provides an ideal solution for creating blogs, documentation, or personal websites.\nAdvantages High Speed: Static Hugo sites load very quickly. Security: Without a database or backend code, vulnerabilities are reduced. Free: GitHub Pages provides hosting services for free. Easy Management: With Git, you can have a complete history of changes. Diverse Themes: Hundreds of free themes are available for Hugo. Prerequisites Install Git (Download) A GitHub account (Sign up) Install Hugo (Installation Guide) Setup Steps 1. Install Hugo To install Hugo, go to this address and install it according to your operating system. I use Arch Linux, so I\u0026rsquo;ll install it with pacman:\n1 sudo pacman -S hugo 2. Create a New Hugo Project Now open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you want your site to be created, then run:\n1 2 hugo new site your-site-name cd your-site-name That\u0026rsquo;s it. You now have a static site.\n3. Add a Theme Go to the Hugo Themes site and choose a theme for your site. Make sure to select a multilingual theme. I chose the stack theme.\nTo install stack, the best way is to use the ready-made template they\u0026rsquo;ve provided. Go to this address and click on Use this template.\nNow select Create new repository.\nIn the window that opens, in the Repository name field, choose the name for the new repository, which is your site. The name format should be like this:\n1 username.github.io where username is your GitHub username.\nNow click create repository. That\u0026rsquo;s it, and your site with the stack theme is set up on GitHub. There\u0026rsquo;s just one more step: go to the settings of the created repository and select Pages. Now change the Build branch from master to gh-pages.\nOkay, our work here is done, and we don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything else here.\n4. Clone the Site Locally Congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve done well so far. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a clone of our site on our local system.\nOpen the terminal and enter this command:\n1 git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git Replace username with your own username. For example, if you want to clone my site:\n1 git clone https://github.com/silvergit/silvergit.github.io.git Now go to the site folder:\n1 cd silvergit.github.io And run Hugo:\n1 hugo server -D The output will give you a link where you can see the local output of your site:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 Built in 133 ms Environment: \u0026#34;development\u0026#34; Serving pages from disk Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop For me, it\u0026rsquo;s: http://localhost:1313/\n5. First Site Post Let\u0026rsquo;s create a new page. To do this, enter this command:\n1 hugo new content posts/hello.md A new markdown file will be created for you in the content folder.\nTip: Use an editor like vscode for writing markdown files.\nCopy this text into the file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 --- title: \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;First site post\u0026#34; date: 2025-12-12T12:53:03+03:30 image: math: license: hidden: false comments: true draft: false categories: [\u0026#34;General\u0026#34;] tags: [] --- This is my first post on this site. Hugo reads the top part of the file and decides what to do with it. For example, when the file was created, what the page title is, or what tags should be introduced for this page.\nThe last line is what you will see in your first post. Close the file and run Hugo again.\n1 hugo server -D 6. Configure the config.toml File The configuration file is usually located at the root of the project, but sometimes you can also find it in the config or config/_default folder.\nYou can see a simple example of the config:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 baseURL = \u0026#34;https://username.github.io/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;fa-ir\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Your Site Title\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;ananke\u0026#34; [params] description = \u0026#34;Your site description\u0026#34; My config looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 # Change baseurl before deploy baseurl = \u0026#34;https://silvergit.github.io/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en-us\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;Morface\u0026#34; # Theme i18n support # Available values: en, fr, id, ja, ko, pt-br, zh-cn, zh-tw, es, de, nl, it, th, el, uk, ar defaultContentLanguage = \u0026#34;fa\u0026#34; # Set hasCJKLanguage to true if DefaultContentLanguage is in [zh-cn ja ko] # This will make .Summary and .WordCount behave correctly for CJK languages. hasCJKLanguage = false # Change it to your Disqus shortname before using disqusShortname = \u0026#34;hugo-theme-stack\u0026#34; [pagination] pagerSize = 5 All my site\u0026rsquo;s config is created in separate files:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 config └── _default ├── config.toml ├── languages.toml ├── markup.toml ├── menu.toml ├── module.toml ├── params.toml ├── permalinks.toml └── related.toml Tip: You can use only one file and copy all these settings into the config.toml file.\nI use the languages.toml file for making the site bilingual:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [fa] languageName = \u0026#34;فارسی\u0026#34; languagedirection = \u0026#34;rtl\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;مورفیس\u0026#34; weight = 1 [en] languageName = \u0026#34;English\u0026#34; languagedirection = \u0026#34;ltr\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;morface\u0026#34; weight = 2 7. Upload Changes to GitHub 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 cd public git init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;First publish\u0026#34; git branch -M main git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git git push -u origin main Important Notes Custom Domain If you want to use a custom domain:\nCreate a CNAME file in the static folder. Enter your domain name in it. Configure your DNS according to the GitHub Pages guide. Search Engine Optimization Use SEO-Friendly themes. Configure meta tags correctly. Choose a readable URL structure. Persian Language Support Set the languageCode value to fa-ir in config.toml. Use themes with RTL support. Add appropriate Persian fonts.
