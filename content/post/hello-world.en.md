This is my first post on this site. I decided to write here again. I started a little late, but [GitPages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) are the best options for static sites in my opinion, and for someone like me who writes mostly about code and Linux, I think a static site hosted by GitHub would be the best option.

I will definitely write an article about building a static site later, because there are few tutorials for it on the internet.

I hope that with what I write here, I can help someone somewhere in the world solve a small problem.
